                <h4>Royal Raid</h4>
                <p>
                  This was an <u>individual</u> class project. In this game, the player is a rogue knight fighting against the army of a corrupt king. 
                  The objective of the game is to enter the king’s castle and defeat him. There are different levels in this game and several enemies on each level. 
                  The player must fight and kill the enemies on each level. The game's finale is a fight with the boss i.e., the King. 
                  The player wins only upon defeating the king. I created this game using <i>Autodesk 3ds Max</i> and <i>Unreal Engine 4</i>.

                <h4>Escape Room</h4>
                <p>
                  This was a <u>group project as well as an individual project</u> and was created using <i>Unreal Engine 4</i>. 
                  In this project, my classmates and I were required to design our separate escape rooms and then combine them. 
                  My escape room consisted of a room with many hallways. One of the hallways led to an exit to be able to escape from my escape room. 
                  The player must use clues provided throughout the escape room and find his/her escape route. Some of the hallways are locked 
                  by combination locks or by locks that require a key. The keys and locks are color coded letting the player figure out the appropriate key for a given lock. 
                  In the case of combination locks, the clues are provided in the escape room.

                <h4>Man Hunt (1st Person Shooter)</h4>
                <p>
                  This was an individual class project and was created using Unreal Engine 4. This game is a first-person shooter, 
                  and the objective is to eliminate five targets (soldiers) without being in their field of view. There are some platforms and 
                  elevators to take the player to these platforms. Some of the targets are on the platforms, and the player must use caution here as their fields of 
                  view are wider and not restricted to the platforms. When the player enters a target's field of view, the player loses one life. The player has three 
                  lives to begin with. If the player loses all three lives, the player loses. 
                  If the player eliminates/kills all targets without losing all three lives, the player wins.

              <h4>Food Site</h4>
              <p>
                This is an <u>individual</u> class project. This is from a Web Design class. The project was to design a website about any kind of food. 
                I chose to create one about Pizza. This website included a <u>home page</u> and an <u>about page</u>.

              <h4>Band/Musical Artist Site</h4>
              <p>
                This is also from the Web Design class and is an <u>individual</u> project. The project was to create a website about a band or a musical artist. 
                I chose to create a site about a band called DragonForce. I obtained information such as the band's members and their albums. 
                This was created using HTML and CSS.

                <h4>Infographic about DeSales University's Facts & Figures</h4>
                <p>
                  This was an <u>individual</u> project that I completed during my Internship at the Marketing and Communications Department at DeSales University. 
                  I was asked to create an infographic video about certain “facts and figures” about the University. 
                  I used <i>Adobe Illustrator</i> and <i>After Effects</i> and some <i>Photoshop</i> features.

                <h4>Animated Infographic about Twitter</h4>
                <p>
                  This was an <u>individual</u> class project. The students were given a list of articles to choose from. I chose an article about Twitter. 
                  We were required to pick facts from the article and create an animated infographic about it. This project consisted of three steps:
                    
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Design Brief, Script, and Storyboard</span> - An overview and plan of the project</li>
                    <li><span>Asset Design</span> - Assets/Icons to use in the final project</li>
                    <li><span>Final Animated Infographic</span> - The final project itself</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This infographic also contains a voice-over given by a student majoring in <strong>Theater</strong> at DeSales University. The storyboard and asset designs were all created in Adobe Illustrator CC. 
                  The infographic itself was animated in <i>Adobe After Effects CC</i>.

                <h4>Stickers for DeSales University Cyber Security & Digital Forensics Department</h4>
                <p>
                  This was an <u>individual</u> assignment. As part of my Internship, I was also asked to create sticker designs for the DeSales University Cyber Security & Digital Forensics department. I used Adobe Illustrator to create two designs. One of the sticker designs was created with a magnifying glass and a lock. 
                  The second sticker design was created using a lock and a shield.

                <h4>Body Mechanics</h4>
                <p>
                  This <u>individual</u> project was completed in a 3D Animation course. Our Professor posted some videos which we could use as reference footage for our project. 
                  These videos were of people performing various actions. I chose the video footage of a man running up to a platform, climbing over and then standing on the platform. We were also given a character to create the animation. Using the reference footage, 
                  I was able to make the movement of the character appear realistic.

                <h4>Lending Library Project</h4>
                <p>
                    This project was completed using Microsoft Visual Studio, with <i>Visual Basic</i> as the coding language. This project is a "Lending Library" application, 
                  which allows the user to pick from a list of books, movies, and/or music. This application enables one to check-out books, like one would do in a library. 
                  This was a project in which I worked with another classmate.

                <h4>A Flow Shop based Algorithm</h4>
                <div>
                  This was a <u>personal and individual</u> project. Wrote a successful <i>Java</i> and <i>Python</i> based algorithmic code to determine the optimal sequence for the 
                  flow of jobs through two machines to minimize total completion time. This is based on an algorithm called Johnson’s Rule and is in the machine scheduling literature. 
                  I wrote this program to practice and enhance my <i>Java</i> and <i>Python</i> skills.

                  This was a <u>personal and individual</u> project. Wrote a successful Java and Python based algorithmic code to sequence a set of jobs for
                  two algorithms with tardiness and the number of tardy jobs being the measures of performance. This program was to practice and enhance my <i>Java</i> and 
                  <i>Python</i> skills.
