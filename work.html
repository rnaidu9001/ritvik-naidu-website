                <h2>Game Design</h2>
                <h3>Royal Raid</h3>
                <p>
                    During my final year at DeSales University, I created a game called “Royal Raid.” This was my Senior Capstone project. 
                    In the game, the player is a rogue knight fighting against the army of a corrupt king. The objective of the game is to go to the king’s castle and defeat him. 
                    There are a certain number of enemies on each map that the player has to defeat. Once a player defeats the required number of enemies (or more), the player can proceed to the next level. 
                    The game ends with a boss fight, and once the player defeats the boss (the king), the player wins. I created this game using Autodesk 3ds Max and Unreal Engine 4.

                <h3>Escape Room</h3>
                <p>
                    The Escape Room project was done in Unreal Engine 4, and was a class project in an "Advanced Game Development" course. This class was my first time using Unreal Engine 4.
                    In this project, my classmates and I were required to design our separate escape rooms and then combine them. My escape room consisted of a room with many hallways. One of them
                    leads to the player escaping the escape room. The player has to use clues provided throughout the escape room and escape. Some of the hallways are locked by combination locks and
                    locks that require a key. The keys and locks are colored, which lets the player know what the right key for a certain lock. Clues to combinations are provided in the escape room.

                <h3>Man Hunt (1st Person Shooter)</h3>
                <p>
                    This game, called "Man Hunt", was created in Unreal Engine 4, just like the escape room, in the same "Advanced Game Development" course. Unlike the Escape Room project, this was an
                    individual project. This game is a first person shooter, and the objective of the game is to eliminate five targets (soldiers) without being in their field of view. There are also platforms
                    to which the player can go to, and elevators which take the player there. Some of the targets are on the platforms, and the player has to be extra careful with them, as their fields of view are
                    not only on the platform. When the player goes into one of the targets' field of view, the player loses one life. The player has three lives to start with. If the player loses all three lives,
                    the player loses. If the player is able to eliminate all the targets without losing all of his/her lives, the player wins.

                <h2>Digital Art</h2>
                <h3>DeSales Facts & Figures Infographic</h3>
                <p>
                    This was the main project I did at my internship as a Web Communications specialist during my final year at DeSales University. For this project, 
                    I was asked to create an infographic video about 
                    certain “facts and figures” about the University. I included information such as the faculty-student ratio, degrees of faculty, etc. 
                    I used mainly Adobe Illustrator and After Effects (and somewhat Photoshop) to create assets and animations such as pie and donut charts.

                <h3>Animated Twitter Infographic</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was done in a Digital Art course. In this course, the students were given a list of articles to choose from. I chose an article about Twitter. We were required to pick
                    facts from the article and create an animated infographic about them. This project consisted of three steps:
                    
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Design Brief, Script, and Storyboard</span> - An overview and plan of the project</li>
                    <li><span>Asset Design</span> - Assets/Icons to use in the final project</li>
                    <li><span>Final Animated Infographic</span> - The final project itself</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This infographic also contains a voice-over done by a Theater Major at DeSales University. The storyboard and asset designs were all created in Adobe Illustrator CC. The infographic
                    itself was animated in Adobe After Effects CC.

                <h3>Lending Library Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was done in a course called "Visual Interface." In this course, we used Microsoft Visual Studio, with Visual Basic as the coding language.
                    This project is a "Lending Library" application, which allows the user to pick from a list of books, movies, and/or music. This application
                    is for the use of checking out books, like one would do in a library. This was a project in which I worked with another classmate.

                <h3>Body Mechanics</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was done in a 3D Animation course at DeSales University. For this project, the professor provided us with videos for which we could use as reference footage for our project.
                    These videos were of people performing various actions. The one I chose was footage of a man running up to a platform, climbing over and on top of it. We were also given a character
                    to create the animation with. Using the reference footage, I was able to make the movement of the character appear realistic.
